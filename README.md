# Sara Vaez

**AI & Machine Learning Practitioner | Finance & Data Science**

Master's in Economics · AI/ML Practitioner Certificate (University of Waterloo)

I build machine learning solutions that solve real business problems — from credit risk modeling to time series forecasting to natural language processing. My background bridges quantitative economics, finance operations, and applied AI, giving me a unique ability to translate complex business challenges into data-driven solutions.

Currently working in Finance at Seaspan ULC (Shipbuilding & Maritime), where I apply analytical and AI-driven approaches to operational and financial process improvement.
